# SQL Project: Sales and Customer Data Analysis
Welcome to our SQL project repository! This project involves analyzing sales and customer data to gain insights into revenue generation, popular product categories, shopping mall performance, and customer preferences.

# Steps:
# Step Zero: Data Exploration
Begin by exploring the sales and customer data to understand its structure and characteristics. This involves examining tables, column names, data types, and unique values.

# Step One: Clean the Data
Clean the data to ensure its quality and reliability. Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and address any inconsistencies or errors in the dataset.

# Step Two: Analyze the Data
Perform comprehensive analysis on the cleaned data to derive meaningful insights. Utilize SQL queries to aggregate, filter, and summarize data as required.

# Step Three: Conclusions
Based on the analysis of the Sales and Customer data, the following conclusions were drawn:

Total revenue generated in 2022: $115,436,814.08.
Most popular product category: 'Clothing', with 103,558 units sold.
Top three shopping malls by sales revenue:
Mall of Istanbul: $50,872,481.68
Metrocity: $37,302,787.33
Gender-wise sales: Females dominated 'Clothing' and 'Cosmetics' categories.
# Payment preferences by age group:

Age group 26-50: Cash > Credit Card > Debit Card

Age group 51-75: Cash > Credit Card > Debit Card

Age group 0-25: Cash > Credit Card > Debit Card

Other age group: Cash > Credit Card > Debit Card

In summary, the data indicates a strong preference for 'Clothing' among shoppers and a consistent use of Cash as the preferred payment method across different age groups.
